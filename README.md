# Savings-Practices-of-Different-Demographic-Groups
Financial Institution - One Way ANOVA
This project is about a financial institution that is interested in the savings practices of different demographic groups. They have demographic data for all of their account holders and have used thatÂ  criteria to split their customers up into 4 groups.
They are going to use the results to do some targeted marketing. In order to determine savings practices, they are going to use the average savings account balance over the past 3 months for their account holders. In other words, they will have one number (average account balance) for each account.
Each demographic group has between 40 and 60 accounts they will look at.
